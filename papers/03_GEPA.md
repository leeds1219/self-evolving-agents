## [GEPA: REFLECTIVE PROMPT EVOLUTION CAN OUTPERFORM REINFORCEMENT LEARNING](https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa-artifact) 
The paper argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards.
To test this, the paper introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error.
